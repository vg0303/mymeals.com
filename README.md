# mymeals.com

It's a landing page for a food delivery company. The main aim of this project was to get familiar with front-end development. To build this website I used HTML and CSS. This allowed me to understand and explore HTML and CSS in depth.

There is one HTML file by the name index.html and two CSS file namely index_css.css and phone.css
I have used google fonts as per my liking but they can be customized according to someone else too.

There is a navbar, a footer and four main sections in HTML file namely: 'home', 'services-container', 'client-sec' and 'contact'. Usage of <section></section> and <div></div> tags made it easier to divide the code into sections.

The index.css has all the major formatting and is used to style the page. I have used phone.css in order to maintain the appearance of the website even when the dimensions are changed, in simple terms to make it responsive. When the width of the page is less than 805px (mentioned in HTML file), phone.css file will be accessed and the formatting will change in order to maintain its appearance.
